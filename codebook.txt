Activities
The following inputs label the activities of subjects in the data set.  The source 
data uses the left index value, this script uses the descriptive label in the right 
column.

1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subjects
Subjects are encoded in this data set via an integer id, from 1-30

Features
The following inputs are a subset of the measurements extracted from the UCI data 
set at:

These variables are described via the source codebook as:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 
3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' 
to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered 
using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner 
frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then 
separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) 
using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time 
to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude 
of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag,
tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, 
fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
